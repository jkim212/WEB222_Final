            The rules of Blackjack is simple. <br>
            <strong>Get as close to 21 as possible, but do not go over it.</strong>
            <br>
            <hr><br>
            <h2>Card Values</h2>
            In Blackjack, an Ace can be counted as either 1 or 10, a face-card is counted as 10.
            Other cards count as its pip value.
            <br><br>

            <h2>Game flow</h2>
            Players start by betting their chips, generally between $2 to $500.
            The cards are then shuffled by the dealer and each player and dealer gets one card each clockwise, facing up.
            Another round of cards are passed around, but this time only the dealer's second card is facing down.
            If any of the player gets an ace and a "ten-card"(note that in Blackjack, all face-cards are ten-cards)
            this is called "Blackjack". If the dealer does not have the same, the player immediately wins 1.5x of his bet.
            If the dealer gets a "Blackjack", all players without "Blackjack" loses their bets.
            If both player and the dealer has a "Blackjack" in their heands, it is a tie and the player takes back their chips.

            <br><br>
            If neither the player and the dealer has a "Blackjack" hand, the game proceeds.
            <br>
            The players will get two options, either to "Hit" or "Stand". Hit option will allow the player to
            receive one additional card from the deck and the player can hit mulitple times
            until the player "busts", or the sum of their cards go over 21, resulting in losing the game.
            Stand will let the player stop from getting any additional cards and let the game move on to 
            the next player.

            <br><br>
            After all the players had their chances to Hit and Stand, the dealer finally shows his faced-down card.
            If the sum of dealer's cards is 17 or above, the dealer cannot add any additional cards to his hand.
            If the sum is below 16, the dealer must add additional cards to his hand until the sum is 17 or above.
            At the end, if the dealer busts, all the players that did not bust will win.
            If the dealers hand sits between 17 and 21, whoever is closest to 21 wins their bet and is paid double.
