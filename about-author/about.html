            <br>This webpage was created for the purpose of final-assessment of WEB222 Course.
            <br><br>Concepts used to create this website were learned throughout the course and this was the
            final project that merged all the things that we have learned into one. One of the main goal of this 
            assessment, if I had to pick, was to learn how to use forms as this was our first and last
            time that we have implemented such object in our website. Since we do not have a server, this 
            webpage only displays the front-end part of the form. In the future, I would like to learn in
            depth as to how to work with the back-end of a website and hopefully WEB322 will cover that part.
            <br><br>The reason I chose Blackjack as my game was actually because it was simple. As soon
            as I heard that our theme was a non-electronic game, I thought of all the boardgames. And then,
            I thought of actually creating a demo of the game inside the website, which would be so cool to have.
            But with my limited javascript skills, I had to choose a game that was simple and yet interesting.
            There was no way I could create a Jenga game without using 3-D model somehow, or snake and ladders
            without having to build a whole board and animate each move. Then, I thought of Blackjack and how
            it is a simple card game with a mathematically simple rule, which at the time I thought was 
            less complicated to code, and would require a simple dynamic display that we have already learned
            in class. It was much more time-consuming than I had expected. But at the end, I am quite proud
            of the result even though it is not yet perfect. I've always wanted to learn web developing and
            without a doubt this was my favourite class this semester. I am going to build on this experience 
            to write something much better next time.
