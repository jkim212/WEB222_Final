            <p><span style="font-size: 80px";>B</span>lackjack, also know as "Twenty-One", 
                is one of the most played games in casinos all around the world. 
                With its history that extends to as far as 1400s, Blackjack
                has been on the gambling tables for ages. Assuming a significant number of
                people in the table, an average of 30 to 40 hands are played an hour, which,
                in comparison to other games, is quite fast-paced.

                While most casino games are brought to you with unreal house edges, 
                Blackjack, if the casino follows its general rules, has a house
                edge of 1%. That being said, if played perfectly in theory,
                your odds of winning can reach up to a whopping 49%. I mean, why waste all the money on Poker
                when you can only waste half of your money in Blackjack?
